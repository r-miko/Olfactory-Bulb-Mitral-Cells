The olfactory bulb in mammals is responsible for receiving, processing and relaying olfactory information.


The olfactory system is capable of determining the distance of odour sources by extracting certain features from odour signals. 
Odours are transformed into a neuronal representation by a number of receptor classes.
The olfactory bulb is omprised of several  cells and layers that receive, process and relay olfactory information.\\
